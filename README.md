# Smiles-For-Nursing-Homes
- Website created through JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- Took about 1 week to finish.
- Designed and Intialized through VSCode.

## DESCRIPTION
This website is designed to help users and volunteers at OU locate specific nursing homes. This website was created in a group project where me and another person were tasked to code a website to present to the class. 

The website prompts the user to enter in:
- Their age 
- Amount of miles they're willing to drive 

and then outputs the nursing home best fit for them.
